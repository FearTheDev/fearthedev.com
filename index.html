                <p>
                  During my CEIS101 class at Devry University I was tasked with building and coding a home security
                  system prototype. It started with the basic concept of just making a basic LED blink.
                  Throughout the course as we learned more about working with an arduino and the various components we
                  were able to add more functionality to the project. We added the ability to simulate if
                  a door was opened or closed. </p>
                <p>Using this same logic I was able to add a state to the system to determine if it was armed or not. If
                  the system was armed, then all security features would work.
                  If the system was disarmed, then the security features would not work. Then I added the ability to
                  detect motion using a sensor. If motion was detected, depending on the distance away it would
                  signal different LED colors and sound the alarm at a slower or faster rate. Lastly during this project
                  I added the ability to check if the room was light or dark, and trigger a signal to turn
                  on or off an LED which symbolized a light bulb.</p>

                <p>During my CEIS106 class at Devry University I learned how to install, configure, manage, and write scripts for automating commonly used tasks. We started with the hands on process of first time installation of the Linux OS. Once were were comfortable with the installation, we learned about the file heiarchy in the Linux operating system and how to traverse directories within the terminal. </p>
                <p>Once comfortable with the basic operation of the Linux OS we then learned how to configure file / directory access. We learned how to configure PATH variables, and how to execute custom scripts. We learned how to troubleshoot and manage various distros of the Linux OS. We learned how to add and remove new user, set their groups, and configure the access permissions. Also, during the course
                  we learned how to configure and troubleshoot the network from the terminal.
